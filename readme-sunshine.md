Project Name: 
Sunshine

Problem: 
User wishes to go to a certain destination, but is unaware when their preferred weather is typically present in the destination.  IE, I want to go to Iceland for vacation, but not when it's -20 degrees.  User then needs to go to multiple sites to research the typical weather in their preferred vacation spot.

UX: 
A sliding scale of temperatures is present next to the input box.  Scale slides from 0 degrees - 100+.
input box on home screen.  user is prompted to type in the city they wish to visit. Hit "go" button.

Cards are then produced beneath the input field of the city (short desc and picture - taken from the Yelp API?).  The month where the avg temp is the user's desired temp is displayed below that city - this can be taken from a weather API.

"As a user, I want to plan a vaction to a specific destination, but would like the research behind the best time to travel to be easier and consolidated."
